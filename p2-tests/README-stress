Stress test instructions
-------------------------

1) copy the following files to the stress-test directory
  - spin.c spin.h
  - counter.c counter.h
  - list.c list.h
  - hash.c hash.h
(The stress test makefile assumes these filenames)


2) make

3) Run stress tests
- ./testCounter 
- ./testList
- ./testHash

Notes: 
- Don't forget to type setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
- ./testCounter stress tests your libcounter.so
if your lib is thread-safe, you should get a "congrats" message
if not, you will get an "argghh" message
- Similarly, ./testHash stress tests your libhash.so; ./testList stress tests your
liblist.so

- Remember to run on machine that has more than one processor (any of the
uchicago linux*.cs.uchicago.edu machines should be suitable)
